# TheQuTritPublic
The Repository Containing Public Projects Worked on By Adam Fattal, Mostafa Touny, Filip RÄ™kawek and Minh Pham. Most Projects will be related to Quantum Computing.

So far, the problems worked on are the following:

## Bell State with Arbitrary Initialized Angles

The problem solved is the following: 

Create a quantum circuit that utilizes nothing but Rx, Ry and CNOT gates to produce the |phi+> Bell State (1/sqrt(2)(|00> + |11>). One condition, however, is that we must use gradient descent as a method to obtain the Rx and Ry parameters  (pi/2,-pi) necessary to create the Bell State


## Maximum Cut Problem with QAOA
